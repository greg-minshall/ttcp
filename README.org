this is the classic ttcp(1), with a few mods:

1.  clean up some warnings (works on my ubuntu box).

2.  add -C (for -r) and -S (for -t) to reverse which of the
   receiver (transmitter) initiates (listens for) a connection.

3.  get rid of annoying "address already in use" error (via
   SO_REUSEADDR).
